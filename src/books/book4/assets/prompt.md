I am rewriting my Persian translation of the book "Task Programming in C# and .NET – Vaskaran Sarcar" (https://github.com/hheydarian/task-programming-in-csharp-dotnet-persian ).
I will send you passages from the original English text.
Your task: translate each passage exactly as it is written—no omissions, no additions—while ensuring the translation is clear, engaging, and easy to understand for someone with absolutely no prior programming knowledge.
All technical terms must be preserved accurately in their original form. The tone should be smooth, professional, and natural in Persian.
After each translation, continue in Persian until I provide the next passage.With related emojis and standard numbers.و استفاده از ایموجی های مرتبط و به تعداد استاندارد برای تایتل ها و متن ها رو فراموش نکن
